                                 of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
                                 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported 
                                 on 30 January 2020. As of 5 July 2020, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has 
                                 confirmed a total of 673,165 cases, 409,082 recoveries (including 1 migration) and 
                                 19,268 deaths in the country.[5] India currently has the largest number of confirmed 
                                 cases in Asia,[8] and has the fourth highest number of confirmed cases in the world[9]
                                  with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May and 200,000 
                                  on 3 June.[10][11] India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 2.80%, against the 
                                  global 6.13%, as of 3 June.[11] Six cities account for around half of all reported cases
                                   in the country â€“ Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[12] As of 24 May 2020,
                                    Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. On 10 June, India's recoveries 
                                    exceeded active cases for the first time reducing 49% of total infections.[13]</p>
